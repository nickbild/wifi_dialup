Dropping dial-up internet access may not be big news in 2025 because a 56K connection isn’t fast enough to do much of anything anymore. But even still, it’s a little bit sad. It’s officially the end of an era. Never again will a teenager have to tell their parents to stay off the phone so they can play *Doom* with their friend down the street. And never again will we actually *hear* our internet traffic.
